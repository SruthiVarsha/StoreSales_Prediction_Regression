Prediction of Store Sales
The success of any retail store depends upon its sales. More the sales made, more is the revenue. With a good customer service and care, the customer too enjoys a good shopping experience. This will lead to more in-flow of customers, opening more store branches across a city / country. To enable this, store owners rely heavily on past data to predict future sales. This will help them in strategizing their business models and come up with innovative techniques and ideas to attract customers and set realistic goals. Many medium to large stores implement this kind of analytics to understand trends like which products are getting sold faster, what are the slow moving products, impact of store types, etc. With new branches of the store, the analysis can get more complex and may also involve stiff competition from other competitors

# Business Objective
